# **Weather App**

### Description and Tech Stack
The main objective of this project is to sharpen my Web Development skills and build an app that I will use frequently. By completing this project, I hope to learn more about serverside code and to deploy this app to its own site for everyone to use and see.

The tech stack I will initially be using is just plain JavaScript and HTML/CSS, but there is a good change I'll use React if need be. I am not sure what hosting service I will use, or if I will use Node.js, but I will update the README to reflect the current tech stack. I plan on using the OpenWeatherAPI to retrieve and update weather data. I don't want to store login information, but this might be good to practice database management.

## Objectives
* Use OpenWeatherAPI
* Be able to change location
* No login required
* The background should change based on the weather
* Provide a week worth's of temperatures and weather conditions
* Maybe implement basic SMTP notifications
* Theme/color options
